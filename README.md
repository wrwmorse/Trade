# Data Exploration of apparel & textile trade imports
This repository is to explore trade data provided by the UN. This looks at all imports into the U.S. beginning with HTS codes 61,62 & 64. The data looks over the past 5 years.
The idea of exploring this data is the hypothetical scenario of wanting to set up my own apparel and footwear company. I want to use alternative sources for the products so I do
not have to compete for suppliers with Nike, Under Armour or Adidas.
